### code:

print("what is your firstname?")

first = input()

print("what is your last name?)

last = input()

print("greetings," first, last + ".")


### our program prompts the user with two questions with an input capability below them. these questions are "what is your first name?" and "what is your last name?" then the program prints out a greeting to whatever the user put in.
